      My name is Diego, but my friends call me Santos. I started programming with an old computer I had at home, known as Canaima. Currently, 
      I am <strong>working as a backend developer in startups in Argentina and Colombia</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of my successes include
      <strong>collaborating with startups in creating robust and scalable applications using technologies like JavaScript and Ruby on Rails.</strong>. 
      Although my journey is recent, I have managed to implement solutions that have significantly improved efficiency and user experience in these companies.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a developer, 
      <strong>I am constantly seeking opportunities to learn and grow, and I am excited about the possibilities that the future holds in the world of backend development.
      </strong> 
      my goal is to enhance the quality of software and facilitate access to high-quality technological solutions for the Hispanic community.
